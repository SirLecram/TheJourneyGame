# TheJourneyGame
It is my own interpretation of game presented in book "Rusz g³ow¹. C#". Only the idea is taken from the book. 
It will be a game where character controlled by player is a knight. He have to fight with powerful monsters using weapons and other equipment found while traveling. 
So... let's try to do that game :).

 


Some graphics was taken from https://openclipart.org/ only for personal use ( to develop my programming skill ;) )! 

The game (of course) is not for commercial use.
